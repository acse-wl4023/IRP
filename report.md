recently, many data-driven approaches for simulating fluid dynamics have been proposed. In 2016, Guo et al. [40] pioneered the application of data-driven CNNs to quickly infer flow solutions. This work contributed to the popularity of CNN in this field to a certain extent[ 41,42,52,63,75,117 ]. Sorteberg et al. [131] is one of the first studies on forecasting the time evolution of a fluid system by deep learning. This architechture commonly used in video-prediction tasks [133], consisted of (i) an encoder composed of convolution layers and a fully connected layer, (ii) an LSTM propagator and (iii) a decoder composed of convolution layers. Although these methods are powerful, they can only infer data-driven solutions on structured mesh. To get solutions on unstructureed mesh, many methods were proposed in which the Graph Neural Network models based on message passing are the most potential method. Belbute-Peres et al. [90] were among the earliest efforts to leverage the learning capabilities of GNNs for fluid dynamics. But it can only predict the next state.
